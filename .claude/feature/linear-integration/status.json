    "2026-02-23T00:00:00Z: Feature created by Kratos. Metis research complete at .claude/.Arena/linear-research.md",
    "2026-02-23T12:00:00Z: PRD created by Athena. 8 P0 requirements, 3 P1, 3 P2. Covers Linear API key auth, team selection, multi-provider sidebar/selector, session linking, and history display.",
    "2026-02-23T13:00:00Z: PRD reviewed by Athena. Verdict: APPROVED WITH NOTES. 4 major issues (stale file names from research, SCSS vs inline styles mismatch, type system redesign not flagged, backward compat missing), 5 minor issues. PRD is fundamentally sound; inaccuracies are from stale research data. Hephaestus must verify file inventory before tech spec.",
    "2026-02-23T14:00:00Z: Tech spec created by Hephaestus. Fresh codebase survey completed — corrected all stale file references from research. Key decisions: raw fetch over @linear/sdk (lighter, no CJS/ESM risk), generic issue_provider+issue_id columns (future-proof), tabs for multi-provider UI, IssueRef discriminated union for type-safe issue references. 4 files to create, 18 files to modify. 5-phase implementation plan. Full backward compatibility preserved.",
    "2026-02-23T15:00:00Z: Tech spec PM review by Athena. Verdict: PASS WITH NOTES. All 8 P0 requirements fully covered. 4 minor issues: search mechanism ambiguity (FR-010), zero-teams edge case not addressed, refresh button missing from UI spec, retry button on network error not explicit. No scope creep. Backward compatibility excellent. 8 of 9 PRD review issues addressed. Approved to proceed.",
    "2026-02-23T15:30:00Z: Tech spec SA review by Apollo. Verdict: PASS WITH NOTES. 0 critical, 2 major (search method gap, IssueProviderStatus scalability), 5 minor. Architecture sound. Both reviews passed — stage 6 (test-plan) unlocked.",
    "2026-02-23T16:00:00Z: Test plan created by Artemis. 69 total test cases across 10 test files. 49 P0 tests, 15 P1 tests, 5 P2 tests. Coverage: all 8 P0 requirements + 3 P1 + 3 P2 requirements. Incorporates all review notes: search clarity (client-side filter), issueProvider validation in saveSession, backward compat (legacy issueNumber sessions), zero-teams edge case, single-team auto-select, error states with retry buttons, network failure handling. Stage 7 (implementation) now unlocked.",
    "2026-02-23T17:00:00Z: Implementation complete by Ares. 9 files created, 21 files modified. 143 tests written and passing (18 test files). 0 lint errors. 0 format errors. Key deviations: search is client-side (per review notes). All P0, P1, P2 tests passing. Stage 8 (code-review) now unlocked."
